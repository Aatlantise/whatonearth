The program aims to determine subject space and projection method of a map image or graphic. The project was first a part of 2016 Wolfram Summer School, then Wolfram Mentorships through summer of 2017, under supervision of Dr. Giorgia Fortuna.

## Getting Started

The program was written in Mathematica. 

### Prerequisites

Wolfram Mathematica 10.1 or later. Program was last compiled on 11.2. The program heavily relies on Wolfram's TextRecognize function, whose dependability varies by version.

### Installing

No need to install anything, if you already have Mathematica.

## Running the tests

A que7 network can be trained in the code, with several tweakable parameters, including network structure, loss function, training rounds, etc. After que7 is trained, the final function can be tested on any given image, with the image as the argument.


## Deployment

The final function should be able to be deployed, using Wolfram Cloud.

## Built With
